Hi @ 
I'm chym, my github account is chymy. I'm interested in kubernetes community research and sharing.

I have commit about dozens of PRs to kubernetes, including some bugs, and some reviewed by you(https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Achymy), issues responded(https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?q=is%3Aissue+commenter%3Achymy),
kubernetes/website(https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Achymy), and kubernetes/community(https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Achymy).

Still now, I'm working on kubernetes,and I want to go deeper in the kubernetes community and join the Kubernetes MemberShip. So, could you be a sponsor for me? 

Thank you very much. I am looking forward to hearing from you.
	
Sincerely,
chym
